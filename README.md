# üéÆ XO Blocker - Browser Extension

A cross-browser extension that blocks adult content websites by displaying an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game overlay with a mandatory time delay.

## üìã Overview

XO Blocker is a self-control tool designed to help users manage their browsing habits. When a user attempts to visit an adult content website, the extension blocks access and displays a fullscreen overlay with a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The user must wait for a configurable timer (default: 5 minutes) before being redirected away from the site.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Smart Detection**: Blocks access using a curated list of 23+ adult domains and 13+ keywords
- **Interactive Game**: Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI using minimax algorithm
- **Mandatory Timer**: Configurable delay (1-60 minutes, default: 5 minutes)
- **Game Loop**: Continuous games until timer expires - each game auto-restarts after completion
- **Fresh Timer Per Visit**: Timer resets on every visit to a blocked site
- **Auto-Redirect**: Automatically redirects to Google.com when timer expires

### Privacy & Security
- **100% Local**: All data stays on your device
- **Zero Tracking**: No data collection, analytics, or external servers
- **No Escape Routes**: No "Continue Anyway" or whitelist buttons
- **Incognito Support**: Works in private browsing mode (user must enable)

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for game controls
- **ARIA Labels**: Screen reader compatible
- **High Contrast**: Readable design with good color contrast

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Detection**: Background service worker monitors all URLs against blocklist
2. **Blocking**: When match found, content script injects fullscreen overlay
3. **Game Loop**: User plays Tic-Tac-Toe games that auto-restart after each match
4. **Timer**: Countdown runs continuously (default: 5 minutes)
5. **Redirect**: After timer expires, user is automatically redirected to home page
6. **Reset**: Each new visit starts a fresh timer

## üîß Customization

### Modify Blocklist
Edit `background.js` lines 6-18:

```javascript
const BLOCKED_DOMAINS = [
  'example.com',  // Add your domains here
  // ...existing domains
];

const BLOCKED_KEYWORDS = [
  'keyword',  // Add your keywords here
  // ...existing keywords
];
```

### Change Default Duration
Edit `background.js` line 94:

```javascript
chrome.storage.local.set({ blockDuration: 10 });  // Change to 10 minutes
```

### Adjust AI Difficulty
The AI uses minimax algorithm (unbeatable). To make it easier, replace the `aiMove()` function in `content-bundle.js` with random move selection.
